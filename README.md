Instrumental Polarization Analysis for Astronomical Optics

## Overview and Structure
The package has one simple goal : Compute 4x4 Mueller matrix for the given optical system, and it is developed keeping astronomical optics in view.
It uses geomatric optics approach i.e., all the analysis uses strictly ray treatment. The most important aspect to remember while delving into using the package is `The Convention`.
